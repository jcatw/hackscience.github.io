<p><a href="https://github.com/hackscience/include.el">include.el</a> manages dependencies between arbitrary chunks of elisp.  It provides a simple dependency syntax along with a few hacks to make the viewing and editing of dependencies easier.  I use it to keep my config file (kind of) sane, and to speed up the process of getting emacs up and running in a new environment.  You may find it useful for managing emacs packages.</p>

<p>To use the manager, put include.el somewhere on your load path, and add the following to your .emacs.

{% highlight common-lisp %}
;; load include mechanism
(require 'include)
{% endhighlight %}

include.el's primary functionality is provided through the  <em>include</em> function and the <em>if-included</em> macro.

{% highlight common-lisp %}
;; enables (if-included 'identifying-symbol ...)
(include 'identifying-symbol)

;; only eval'd if (include 'identifying-symbol) has been eval'd
(if-included 'identifying-symbol
             (some stuff)
             (some other stuff))
{% endhighlight %}

I put a set of includes right in the header of my .emacs file for easy access, commenting out whatever I'm not using at the moment.

{% highlight common-lisp %}
;; ========================================================================== ;;
;; Includes - comment these out to prevent the feature from loading
;; ========================================================================== ;;
;;; font
(include 'menlo)

;;; languages
;; lisps
(include 'allegrocl)
					;(include 'sbcl :depends 'slime)
(include 'abcl :depends 'slime)
					;(include 'clojure :depends 'slime)
					;(include 'scheme)
;; interpreted
(include 'python)
(include 'R)
(include 'node)
					;(include 'javascript)


;; other
					;(include 'scala)

;;; markup
					;(include 'mustache)

;;; tools
(include 'slime)
					;(include 'git)
					;(include 'auto-complete)
					;(include 'eclim)

;;; themes
(include 'zenburn)

;;; shells
(include 'umass-shells)
(include 'home-shells)
{% endhighlight %}

Then, I wrap the subsequent package-loading / config / whatever code in an if-included block.

{% highlight common-lisp %}
;; eli
(if-included 'allegrocl
	     (push "/Applications/acl82/eli" load-path)
	     (load "fi-site-init.el")
	     (setq fi:common-lisp-image-name "/Applications/acl82/alisp") 
	     (setq fi:common-lisp-image-file "/Applications/acl82/alisp.dxl") 
	     (setq fi:common-lisp-directory "/Applications/acl82"))

;; node.js	     
(if-included 'node
	     (setenv "NODE_NO_READLINE" "1")  ;setting this env var fixes the node repl prompt
	     (defun node ()
	       (interactive)
	       (make-comint "node" "node")
	       (switch-to-buffer (get-buffer "*node*"))))

;; menlo font
(if-included 'menlo (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Menlo-16"))

;; ess
(if-included 'R
	     (require 'ess-site)
	     ; turn off auto underscore-to-assignment-arrow
	     (ess-toggle-underscore nil))
;; slime
(if-included 'slime
	     (require 'slime)
	     (setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.lisp$" . lisp-mode))
					   auto-mode-alist))
	     (setq slime-net-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)
	     (slime-setup '(slime-fancy))
	     ;; steel bank common lisp
	     (if-included 'sbcl (setq inferior-lisp-program "/usr/local/bin/sbcl"))
	     ;; armed bear common lisp
	     (if-included 'abcl (setq inferior-lisp-program "abcl")))
;;; python
(if-included 'python
	     (require 'python-mode)
	     (autoload 'python-mode "python-mode" "Python Mode." t)
	     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.py\\'" . python-mode))

	     ;; rebind C-del to delete word
	     (add-hook 'python-mode-hook
		       (lambda ()
			 (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "C-<backspace>") 'backward-kill-word))))
{% endhighlight %}

Note that if-included blocks can nest, as demonstrated in the slime block above.</p>

<p>include.el provides a simple mechanism for managing dependencies between includes.  One can add a :depends keyword to the include function call to specify a parent dependency which must be loaded first.  Under the hood, include.el constructs the directed dependency network and identifies a valid topological ordering via depth-first search.  Above, we use this mechanism to only load the abcl (armed bear common lisp) package if the slime interface is included.</p>


<p>Finally, and <strong>importantly</strong>, be sure to add <strong>(eval-included)</strong> to the end of your .emacs configuration.  The elisp blocks wrapped in if-included are not evaluated when the macro is evaluated, but are rather stored in a hash table called *included-elisp*.  This allows you to write your if-included blocks completely out of dependency order.
{% highlight common-lisp %}
;; evaluate included elisp, respecting dependencies
(eval-included)
;;; .emacs ends here
{% endhighlight %}
(eval-included) identifies the proper load ordering and then sequentially evaluates the stored elisp.</p>
  
<p>A few editing commands are provided as well.  Let's say that we want to edit our python-related configuration.  <em>M-x view-include name</em> will place an invisible overlay over all irrelevant content, leaving only the python-related elisp:

{% highlight common-lisp %}
;; interpreted
(include 'python)

;;; python
(if-included 'python
	     (require 'python-mode)
	     (autoload 'python-mode "python-mode" "Python Mode." t)
	     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.py\\'" . python-mode))

	     ;; rebind C-del to delete word
	     (add-hook 'python-mode-hook
		       (lambda ()
			 (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "C-<backspace>") 'backward-kill-word))))
{% endhighlight %}
<em>M-x unview-include</em> will make the entire buffer visible again.  For convenience, view-include and unview-include have been bound to <em>C-c m i</em> and <em>C-c m u</em>, respectively.</p>
