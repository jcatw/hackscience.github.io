The pain of dealing with jekyll and github pages has become too much.
I want to write extensions but I don't want to learn ruby.  I want to
compile a whole site, including a landing page, rather than just a
blog.  I want jatwood.org to have something other than a redirect to
my UMass CS page.  I want to minimize all of the js I throw in here
and resize images without thinking about it.  I want to have actual
views for things.  I want to fit a markov chain to my posts and have
it post for me and see if anyone notices.

So, uh, I decided to roll my own static blog generator, or rather,
hack the bejesus out of someone else's framework
([obraz](http://obraz.pirx.ru/), a very nice partial Jekyll clone
written in Python).  Soon I'll be transitioning this blog to the new
system.  The permalinks will probably change to something prettier,
but everything should redirect.
