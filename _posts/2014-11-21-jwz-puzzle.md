Ok, does this hex mean anything to anyone?  

    47E0 E2BD FAAF 7FE2 F206 C9F6 939F E07E

It's the first line of a hexdump.  It doesn't seem to map to any magic
numbers or file headers.  I'm stumped.

For reference, I've been scraping the hex on [jwz.org](http://www.jwz.org) for a while (and scraped everything in the wayback machine).  It definitely looks like some kind of hexdump; the displayed chunks change over time.  It probably means something, because:

    <!-- mail me if you find the secret -->
    <!--   (no, you can't have a hint)  -->

I have much more but I don't want to ruin the fun by posting it. Please email if you have an inkling.
