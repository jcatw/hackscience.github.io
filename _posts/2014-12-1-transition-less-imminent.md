I [previously]({% post_url 2014-11-20-transition-imminent %}) mentioned that this blog would be transitioning to a new system soon-ish.  As of now, though, I'm not really sure how soon soon-ish will be.  I have something written that is compatible with present-blog, looks much nicer, and is Probably Good Enough, but something about it just drives me up the wall.

I'm really starting to understand the appeal of technologies like node.js that stack javascript turtles all the way down, even for things like 'service of content' that any reasonable person would delegate to nginx or apache or something.  I've been rolling my own, then hiding the diversity under a pretty mod_rewrite cover, and there are just *so many fucking couplings* between model, view, and controller that I want to pack up and move to appalachia and die on some frigid god-forsaken mountain.

You can see a super-secret version of where things stand [here](http://54.174.46.82/).  It does look cool and consumed way more hours than I care to admit, but it just isn't the nerdvana I was looking for, yet.  I think it will be, soon - all I really need is a top-level magic substitution hack that I can bake into the build, so I can say 'HEY WHERE DO IMAGES LIVE' and it will say 'IN /img BUDDY' and all will be well.
