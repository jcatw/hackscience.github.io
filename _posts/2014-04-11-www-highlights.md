- [Justin Cheng](http://www.clr3.com/)'s talk on predicting cascades in social networks was just beautiful.
- "The original Yahoo search engine implementation was a system call to grep." -- [Qi
  Lu](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/exec/lu/)
- [Tim Berners-Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) warned us all of [the impending
  singularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit) in a monster voice.
- I had great conversations with [Bob West](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~west1/) (who works with [Jure
  Leskovec](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/)) and [Joel Pfeiffer](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jpfeiff/) (who
  works with [Jen Neville](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/neville/)) about generative models of graphs, why they are
  important, and how to deal with the inherent horrific intractability of the problem.
  [Joel](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jpfeiff/) gave a great talk on the subject.
- [Bob](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~west1/) told me that you can buy a 1Tb (random access) memory machine for about
  $10,000.  I want it.  He also had this great insight that if you are disk-bound, but have a ton of ram, load the data
  into memory once and keep it there, querying it from client programs.
