I'm back with CNRG at UMass after a summer at Technicolor Research.
The work lives on - Udi and I are collaborating on a probabilistic
graphical model for predicting privacy-compromising posts to social
networks.

I... I think I'm a machine learning lifer.  This stuff is just fun.
Inference is fun. Modeling is fun. Implementing it is fun. It is just
so damned *useful*, too.
